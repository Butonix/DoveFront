One thing we got struck was the concept of one ture God. Peoples are often arguing about their own God's image and acting weirdly about their very existence and meaning of life. We were totally convinced that there is only one ture God. The God Almighty will shower up us as long as we have faith in him.",

It was so difficult for them to attain our everydays programs. So we suggested them to perform Satsangs on their local peoples with their fellow believers. This idea lead us to Branch registrations under 'Ishworiya Marg Bhajan Mandal Sachchai Kendra Nepal'. Now we have hundreds of branches throughout the country and number of branches in aboard countries like Japan, Korea, Australia etc.",
